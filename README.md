# Sales Data Analysis

This project analyzes sales data using Python, Pandas, SQLite, and Matplotlib. It involves loading sales data from a CSV file, cleaning and transforming the data, storing it in an SQLite database, and performing various analyses to gain insights into sales trends, top-selling products, and regional performance.

## Project Overview

The project performs the following tasks:
- Loads sales data from a CSV file.
- Cleans and preprocesses the data (handling missing values).
- Stores the data in an SQLite database for easy querying.
- Runs SQL queries to calculate total revenue, top-selling products, and monthly revenue.
- Performs statistical analysis (average, median, and standard deviation) of sales data.
- Generates visualizations for:
  - Monthly sales trends.
  - Best-selling products.
  - Sales distribution across orders.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQLite**: Database used to store and query the sales data.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization library to plot graphs and charts.
- **NumPy**: For statistical analysis of the data.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- sqlite3 (comes with Python)
- matplotlib

You can install the necessary libraries using `pip`:
